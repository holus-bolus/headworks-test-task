# Event Management Application

This project is a full-stack event management application built with a React frontend and an Express.js backend. The backend connects to a MongoDB database for data storage.

## Features

- **Event Creation**: Add new events with details such as name, description, date, and tickets.
- **Event Listing**: View a list of all created events.
- **Event Updating**: Update the details of existing events.
- **Event Deletion**: Remove events from the list.
- **MongoDB Integration**: All data is stored in MongoDB via the Express.js backend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or above)
- **npm** (Node package manager)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or a cloud MongoDB instance)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-management-app.git
   cd event-management-app

    Install client dependencies:

    bash

cd client
npm install

Install server dependencies:

bash

    cd ../server
    npm install

MongoDB Setup

    Local MongoDB: If you're using a local MongoDB instance, ensure it is running.
    MongoDB Atlas: If you're using MongoDB Atlas, ensure your connection string is correctly set up.

Running the Application
Running the Backend Server

    Start the Express.js server:

    bash

    cd server
    npm start

    The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

Running the Frontend

    Start the React development server:

    bash

    cd client
    npm start

    The React app will start on http://localhost:3000.

Building the Application

To build the React frontend for production:

bash

cd client
npm run build

The build will be optimized for deployment.
Testing

Currently, there are no specific tests implemented. However, you can write your own tests using a framework like Jest or React Testing Library for the frontend, and Mocha or Jest for the backend.
